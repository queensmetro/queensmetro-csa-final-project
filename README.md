**Java Adventure Game Project: Code Quest**

**Project Overview**
You will design and implement a Java-based text adventure game. The game should be interactive,
story-driven, and include game mechanics such as lives, points, level progression, decision trees,
and ASCII art to enhance visual storytelling.
Project Requirements

**Game Mechanics**
- Players start with 3 lives.
