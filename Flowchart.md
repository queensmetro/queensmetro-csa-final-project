🔍 Pre-Coding Task: Story Flowchart Using Lucidchart

Before you start coding your Java text adventure game, you’ll plan your game logic and story flow using a flowchart in Lucidchart. This helps ensure your game's decisions, stages, and outcomes are well-structured and easier to implement later in Java.
🎯 Objective

Create a flowchart in Lucidchart that maps out the storyline, decision points, levels, and outcomes of your game. This will act as your game design blueprint.
📌 Flowchart Instructions

**Log into Lucidchart**

        Go to: https://lucid.app

        Sign in with your school Google account (or create a free account).

**Create a New Document**

        Click “+ New” > “Lucidchart Document”.

        Title it something like: AdventureGameFlowchart_YourName.

**Start with the Game Intro**

        Use a Start/End (oval) shape to indicate the beginning.

        Add a rectangle to show the game’s intro text or setup (e.g., “You wake up in a forest…”).

**Add Decision Points**

        Use diamond shapes for choices (e.g., “Go left or right?”).

        Label each path clearly with the user input expected (e.g., “Go left → lose a life”, “Go right → next level”).

**Show Outcomes & Stages**

        Map out all 3 levels or stages of your game using labeled rectangles (e.g., “Stage 2: The Cave”).

        For each level, include:

            At least 1 riddle or question (can be in a rectangle or callout).

            At least 2 decision points.

**Track Lives and Points**
        Show where lives are lost, extra lives gained, or points awarded.

        Example: A wrong answer leads to a diamond labeled “Lose 1 life?” followed by a new path.

**Indicate Game Endings**

        Include at least 2 possible endings:

            One where the player wins (e.g., “You escape the forest!”).

            One where the player loses all lives.

**Add Notes or Comments (Optional)**

        Use callout boxes or sticky notes to explain ASCII art ideas, hidden bonuses, or special conditions.

**Review Checklist**
    ✅ Start and end points
    ✅ At least 3 stages
    ✅ At least 5 decision points
    ✅ At least 3 questions/riddles
    ✅ Tracks lives and points
    ✅ Shows different story outcomes

    Share or Export Your Flowchart

    Click “Share” to create a viewable link to submit.

    Or click “File > Download As > PDF” and upload it to the assignment submission.

**💡 Tips**
    Use colors to show different types of actions (e.g., red = lose a life, green = points).

    Keep paths labeled clearly so you can easily turn them into Java code later.

    Think through cause and effect—what happens with each player choice?

🔄 What’s Next?

Once your flowchart is approved or complete, you’ll use it as your guide to start coding your Java adventure game. Your flowchart should help you write cleaner, more organized logic using if/else, switch, loops, and methods.
