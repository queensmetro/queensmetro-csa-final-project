If you want two students to be able to access the same code file at the same time you could try GitHub Codespaces with the Live Share plugin. 
It's based on VS Code which is one of the most popular code editors. 
Free accounts get 120 core hours of usage per month and verified students get 180 core hours per month completely free - 
even the free tier should be easily enough for classes (it would allow you to run your code on an 2 core machine for 60 hours every month) 
but the student pack is worth it anyway as it's completely free and gives your students access to lots of other niceties like Copilot and JetBrains IDEs.

If you're just wanting to put your sample code somewhere the students can copy and paste from, you could set up a repo on GitHub or give the students a link to a GitHub Gist.
